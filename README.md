### Overview

Virtual Reality is a relatively new development path in gaming, training, experiential learning (and the list goes on).  The group of contributors listed above decided to tackle a problem that they felt could help data scientists analyze how users play games or interact with the virtual environments they are placed in.  By doing so, the comfort level of games could be changed to make the experience more enjoyable and realistic, while helping developers understand the nuances or hardships their ideas are placing on users.  As a team, we are proud that we could deliver this application to help those across the VR space accomplish more with this great technology.  Enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed developing it.

### Getting Started
Before you perform any of the steps below, please make sure you have the minimum components and requirements as described above.

It is very important to have your Oculus Rift and the Sensor plugged into your machine prior to beginning the application as the program will be deemed unusable otherwise.  

With your Rift and Sensor plugged into your machine, please perform the following steps:  

_NOTE: PERFORM STEP 1 ONLY ONCE_
1. Clone the repository onto your machine
    * `git clone https://github.com/jselmani/cyclops.git`
2. Change into the cyclops/exe directory to find the executable
    * `cd cyclops/exe`
3. Start the application
    * `./Cyclops.exe`
4. In the Menu Bar, go to:
    * `Help->Quick Guide` to learn how to use the application correctly.
    
### Contributing

If there are new features or issues that you find in the application, please open an issue in the repository so it can be addressed. Pull requests are also welcome!

More information about setting up your environment for more development will be added shortly!

### Special Thanks
I would like to thank the other core contributor of this project, Joseph Pildush, for his commitment to the project.  With so much other development projects in our midst, this one always seemed to take the backburner, but we got it done.  Thank you.
