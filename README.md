### Overview

Virtual Reality is a relatively new development path in gaming, training, experiential learning (and the list goes on).  The group of contributors listed above decided to tackle a problem that they felt could help data scientists analyze how users play games or interact with the virtual environments they are placed in.  By doing so, the comfort level of games could be changed to make the experience more enjoyable and realistic, while helping developers understand the nuances or hardships their ideas are placing on users.  As a team, we are proud that we could deliver this application to help those across the VR space accomplish more with this great technology.  Enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed developing it.
